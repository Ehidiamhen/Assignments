            <p>Welcome to my Portfolio Website.</p> 
            <p>I am Aigbiluese Ehidiamhen, a young Frontend Developer fascinated with tech 
            and focused on building simple yet elegant and functional user interfaces.</p>

        <h2>More About Me</h2>
        <p>
          I am currently based in Abuja, Nigeria. I began my tech journey last year,
          but only became serious about it early this year. Since then I've been learning
          Frontend Development, and it has been great so far.
        </p>
        <p>
          During my free time I enjoy reading books, writing articles, listening to music,
          and of course surfing the internet for wonderful interfaces.
        </p>
        <p>
          I also value keeping up with the vast world of tech. As systems, products, and
          languages are constantly being updated, there is always more than enough information 
          to consume.

              This was my first real project as a Frontend Developer,
              and I built it with pure HTML and CSS.It wasn't easy for me 
              as a beginner, and there are quite some mistakes, but it gave me 
              some much needed experience in creating and styling elements.

            <p class="project-details">
              This single-page project was built using the 'Glassmorphism Effect',
              in which elements are made transparent, allowing the background to shine 
              through. This was a little bit different, as I employed the services of 
              the CSS pre-processor known as Sass which streamlines styling with some unique features.

              I did this during the I4GxZuri training, which is a very
              structural and fast-paced program aimed at giving beginners a solid foundation.
              This pure HTML project is in no way beautiful as no styling was
              applied, but it is a great beginner-friendly project in understanding 
              HTML structure.

              Before going into Frontend Development, I gained little 
              experience in using the Python library Tkinter to create 
              user interfaces to do basic tasks such as playing music 
              from a directory, and recording data for a game show.
